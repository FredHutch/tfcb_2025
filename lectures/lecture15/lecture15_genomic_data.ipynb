    "# `GenomicRanges` Object to Store Genomic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Genomic data is often described using chromosomes and coordinates. A locus can be a single base position or a region that includes a start and end coordinate. In R, there is a Bioconductor package called `GenomicRanges` that stores this in a convenient structure for efficient querying using routine operations. `GRanges` object class is in which genomic data will be stored. We will demonstrate the most common operation, `findOverlaps`, to determine intersecting positions or regions in the genome. See https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/GenomicRanges/inst/doc/GenomicRangesIntroduction.html\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional package called `plyranges` provides convenient syntax similar to that used in `tidyverse` to manipulate and apply operations on `Granges` objects. See https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/plyranges/inst/doc/an-introduction.html\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will work with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data for primary breast cancer patient samples. Specifically, these are segmentation data used for copy number alteration analysis. See Lecture 16: Slide 47."

The argmuents `query` for your main `tiles.subset` and `subject` for the `segs.gr`.
