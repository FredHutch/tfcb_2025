# Lecture 17: Immune repertoire sequencing and analysis

In this lecture, we will learn how to work with immune repertoire sequence data, with a focus on antibody mutation analysis.
Open lecture17.ipynb in VS Code and make sure to select your **Python kernel** for running code.

The lecture will begin with a short introduction to immune repertoire sequencing and the biological processes that generate antibody diversity (V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation). We will then complete a tutorial to explore mutations in antibody sequences.

## Learning Objectives 
- Understand the basics of immune repertoire sequencing
- Interpret key fields in IMGT/V-QUEST AIRR-formatted outputs
- Compare observed antibody sequences to their inferred germline sequences

## Class materials
- The lecture slides are available [here](lecture17_slides.pdf)
- The Notebook which will be using for this lecture is available at [lecture17.ipynb](lecture17.ipynb)
